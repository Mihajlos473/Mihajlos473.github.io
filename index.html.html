            <p>Here's where you're at right now.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>You have a powerful message that you want to share with the world.</p> <br><br>
            <p>You have a product or service that's successful and gets your customers results.</p>
                <br><br>
            <p>But if your people are winning, why aren't you winning on a scale you're supposed <br><br>
                to be winning?</p>
                <br><br>
            <p>What's stopping you from getting the entire world to know you?</p>
                <br>
                
            <p>Your problem is not that your funnel isn't working, you have low conversions, <br><br>your
                positioning is off, your copy sucks, or that your service isn't valuable.</p>
                <br>
                
            <p>Your #1 problem is obscurity. Your problem is getting the world to know you, your<br><br>
                products, and your services.</p><br>
            <h2 class="center">It's time to stop competing and dominate your market.</h2> <br>
            <p>But first, let me ask you a question.</p><br>
            <p>When you think of entrepreneurship... Who's the first guy that comes to mind?<br><br>(Gary Vee).</p><br>
            <p>When you think of sales... Who's the first person that comes to mind? <br><br>(Grant Cardone).</p><br>
            <p>When you think of personal development... Who's the first person that comes <br><br>to mind? (Tony Robbins).</p> <br> 
            <p> ... And when you look up how to code, you won't get very far without coming <br><br>across me :).</p><br>
            <p>Now the question is, how do you build that relationship with your audience<br><br> where you're always the first person to come in their mind?</p><br> 
            <p> Let me first tell you what won't work.</p><br> 
            <p>Blogging for optimized keyword terms or SEO.</p> <br>
            <p>Focusing on the best tags or titles on your YouTube video.</p> <br>
            <p>Going to local networks to pass your business cards.</p> <br>
            <p>You already know this, just saying it anyway.</p> <br>
            <p> Now, here is what WILL work.</p> <br>
            <p>First you need a product or service that the world needs (you already got this <br><br>part down).</p><br>
            <p>Second, you need to build trust and authentic relationship with your audience.</p><br>
            <p>People like Gary Vee, Grant Cardone, Tony Robbins, or anyone else who's<br><br> dominating their market, are dominating that market for one reason and one <br><br>reason only. Trust.</p><br>
            <p>They've built businesses that will last the test of time. Even way after they die.</p><br>
            <p> Everyone is always looking for a "unique selling proposition". If you have an<br><br> audience of raving fans that trust you, you don't need to be unique. Harley<br> <br>Davidson doesn't need to be unique to sell bikes. Gary Vee just wrote a sequel<br><br> to "Crush It" called "Crushing It!". Doesn't sound very unique to me. But, do <br><br>you think he sold a s*** load of copies? I think so.</p><br>
            <p>That's the place I want you to be. In a place where you're the ONLY one who is the <br><br>first and the right choice for your customer.</p><br>
            <p>Now, let's say we want to build an authentic connection with our audience and<br><br> customers... How should we do it? The best way would be to meet these people <br><br>in person. Face to face. Just you and them. They can see your passion, feel <br><br>your energy, and get their questions answered. You can get them to see <br><br>you as an authority, build a strong relationship with you, and they might even <br><br>purchase your product or service on the spot.</p><br>
            <p>But... that might be a little difficult and harder to scale.</p><br>
            <p> Hmm... Okay let's try another way. Public speaking. When you speak on a stage in<br><br> front of select audiences, there's nothing better than building authority, establishing <br><br>a relationship, and growing your business. But, when your talk is over... It's over. <br><br>If I wanted to share your message with someone, it wouldn't be very easy for me to do.</p><br>
            <p>Landing public speaking engagements at events like Converkit, T&C, or Growthcon <br><br>are already a difficult task and even if you can land them, there is only a limited <br><br>number of them you can do. Also, your message is only limited to that room, <br><br>instead of the whole world.</p><br>
            <p> Now what if you could build your authority, establish an authentic relationship with <br><br>your audience, and sell more of what you have to your potential customers. And <br><br>you could do this all in a way that feels like you're speaking face to face with them <br><br>where they can still feel your presence, energy, and get incredible amounts of <br><br>value from your content. And it doesn't matter what part of the world they're in.</p><br>
            <p>This is the power of video marketing.</p><br>
            <p>This is what I do.</p><br>
            <p>I help you build your authority, overcome obscurity, scale your business, and build <br><br>an audience of ideal buyers for your products or services by leveraging the power <br><br>of video marketing through YouTube.</p><br>
            <p>Just to be clear. This is not about making viral cat videos. Ad revenue. Affiliate <br><br>marketing. Selling t-shirts. Or using tags, descriptions, or SEO to rank<br><br> #1 on YouTube.</p><br>
            <p>I help smart online marketers & successful business owners who want to build trust <br><br>with their audience and scale their business leveraging YouTube.</p><br>
            <p>It's really weird that no-one is teaching this stuff. Most people are just teaching you <br><br>how to get more subscribers, likes, and comments on YouTube with videos like<br><br> "Learn how to get your first 1000 subscribers FAST in 2017".</p><br>
            <p>I want to show you how to use YouTube as not just a powerful growth strategy but a <br><br>system that will automate your business so that your leads are consistent, growth is <br><br>systemic, and revenue is reliable.</p><br>
            <p>I also have a special gift for you.</p><br>
            <p>I want to show you behind the scenes on how I've leveraged YouTube to build a <br><br>business from scratch that has generated over $450,000 in less than 15 months...</p><br>
            <p>Disclaimer: This juicy lead magnet is under construction. But don't worry, for now, <br><br>get on my email list. Grab some popcorn. Kick up your recliner. And when it's ready, <br><br>I'll shoot it straight over &lt;3. </p><br>
